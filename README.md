# Build and Command-Line Execution Instructions:

To ensure that the correct version of pip, pandas, and numpy is installed:

1. Type 'curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py' in the command line. Press the return key.
2. Type 'python3 get-pip.py' in the command line. Press the return key.
3. Type 'pip install pandas' in the command line. Press the return key.
4. Type 'pip install numpy' in the command line. Press the return key.

To run the program from the command-line:

5. Type 'python3 main.py'.

**NOTE:** This will overwrite all epoch stat files and graphs with new versions. Most stats and graphs will remain fairly the same as old versions of them. The locations where significant alterations in content may occur is for task components that required randomization of the iris.data, being Task 4.1 and Task 4.2.
